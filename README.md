Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - awesome web-based text editor

And of course [Noting](https://kartik110.pythonanywhere.com/) itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/Kartik11082/Noting) on GitHub.

## Local server setup

Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/Kartik11082/Noting.git
cd Noting
```

Install the dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Start the local server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

Go to localhost port 8000
Now you can start testing
